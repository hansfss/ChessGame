# Chess application
Unfinished chess application coded in C#. Still need to:
-implement correct movement of every piece
-prevent errors when pieces are moved outside bounds of board
-fix repeated turn bug
-implement all end game scenarios (what are all the fuckin rules of chess???)
-other stuff probably idk wtf im doing
